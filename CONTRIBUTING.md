Thanks for showing interest to contribute to HelloKit UI ðŸ’–, you rock!

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you
prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to HelloKit UI:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/kimani-kabiria/hello-kit-ui)

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/hello-kit-ui.git
cd hello-kit-ui
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `npm install`. This
   command will install dependencies.

## Development

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. HelloKit UI
uses a react, tailwind & radix-ui. In the library, we have components and UI Layouts each on their respective folders and can be consumed in isolation.

### Tooling

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage packages and dependencies.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for rapid UI component development and
  testing.
- [Radix UI Primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) core components building block.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for commit management.

### Commands

**`npm install`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for
cross-component development and builds all components.

**`npm run storybook`**: starts storybook server and loads stories in files that
end with `.stories.tsx`.

**`npm run build`**: run build for all component packages.

**`npm run test`**: run test for all component packages.

**`npm run release`**: publish changed packages.

**`npm run prepare`**: prepare installation for development.

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction
with a code example. The best way to show a bug is by sending a CodeSandbox
link.

## Proposing new or changed Components / UI?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample code. Proposals that
don't line up with our roadmap or don't have a thoughtful explanation will be
closed.

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when
the PR author is a collaborator, that counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

#### Our Categories
- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new
  features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing
  ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

#### Our Scopes
- `UI`: Any changes made to UI layouts or elements. Hosted in the src/ui directory.
- `Components`: Any changes made to components. Hosted in the src/components directory.
- `Core`: Any changes made within the src/ directory.
- `Docs`: Any changes made to any documentation within the library.
- `Test`: Any changes made any test file within the library.
- `Config`: Any changes made any config file within the library.
- `Website`: Any changes made to files and component involved with the library's website.
- `Story`: Any changes made any storybook file within the library.

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the hello-kit-ui repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention
   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/accordion-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type`
   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

3. Make and commit your changes following the
   [commit convention](https://github.com/kimani-kabiria/hello-kit-ui/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention).
   As you develop, you can run `npm run build` and
   `npm run test` to make sure everything works as expected.

4. Run `npm run release` ( Other release script commands are on the package.json file ) to create a detailed description of your changes. This
   will be used to generate a changelog when we publish an update.
   Please note that you might have to run `git fetch origin main:master` (where
   origin will be your fork on GitHub) before `pnpm changeset` works.

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

> **Dear HelloKit UI team:** Please do not merge code without tests
